### WIP

Using this to learn Rust and see what all the fuss is about.

# Git Rip

A command line utility which deletes merged git branches conveniently.

 - deletes all branches on your local machine merged into a branch you specify.
 - allows you to protect specific branches to never be deleted.

### Why

I often work on multiple branches every day and rarely delete branches I work on, review and test. This results in a messy directory where I end up cleaning things manually.

### Installation

TODO

### Usage

TODO

Add a protected directory
```sh

```
